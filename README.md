# Selena-Chatbot
Simple selena from PGR chatbot using NLTK. 
Chatbot that i learn and inspire by [Patrick resp](https://github.com/patrickloeber/pytorch-chatbot). Go check his repository.
I think this is good idea to implement this NLP to Discord chat.
After fighting with ERROR by the help of ChatGPT.
I'm done with this project.
